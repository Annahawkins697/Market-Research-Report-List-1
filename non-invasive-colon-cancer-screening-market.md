<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non Invasive Colon Cancer Screening Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT)</li><li>Guaiac-based Fecal Occult Blood Test (gFOBT)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The non-invasive colon cancer screening market primarily includes two types: Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) and Guaiac-based Fecal Occult Blood Test (gFOBT). FIT detects blood specifically from cancer or polyps using antibodies, providing higher sensitivity and specificity. In contrast, gFOBT relies on the chemical reaction of hemoglobin in stool samples, which can yield false positives due to dietary factors. Both tests offer convenient, at-home screening options, helping to increase adherence to colorectal cancer screening guidelines.</p></p>
