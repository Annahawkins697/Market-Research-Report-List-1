<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Resuscitation Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-inflating Resuscitator</li><li>Flow-inflating Resuscitator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cardiac resuscitation devices market primarily includes self-inflating and flow-inflating resuscitators. Self-inflating resuscitators are portable, manually operated devices that automatically refill with air after use, making them suitable for emergency situations. Flow-inflating resuscitators, on the other hand, require a continuous gas supply and are often used in controlled settings, providing precise volume delivery and higher pressures. Both device types play crucial roles in delivering effective ventilation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and emergency medical interventions.</p></p>
